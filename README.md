# Quiz-trivia04-22
- I want to create a coding timed quiz with about 5 questions

## Expectations:
- The test must be timed at every question by 75seconcds.
- Click start for everything
- Clicking one of the choices leads to another question
- When I answer wrong, time is subtracted by 5 seconds.
- Game is over when questions finish or timer is 0
- Save your score by adding initials or go back to try again.
